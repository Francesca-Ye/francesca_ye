### About

Currently a **Bachelor of Information** student at the University of Toronto’s iSchool. Research Profile Curator at the VPRI and Student Library Assistant at the Engineering and Computer Science Library. **Incoming Summer 2024 Member Information Management Intern at the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.** 

Emerging records manager. Critical observer. Expert in delivering and maintaining accurate information. Detail-oriented. Adept at developing information systems that answer organizational needs. Passionate about making knowledge accessible to all. 

Prior to joining the BI program, I was studying History, Philosophy, and Digital Humanities at the University of Toronto with membership to Victoria College. During my studies in these disciplines, I gained a holistic perspective on the historical and modern relationship between humans and technology.

I am largely interested in information science issues as they relate to culture and ethics with a specific focus on transitions into new information policies to account for advances in technology. **Epistemic injustice, and knowledge equity are topics that I am passionate about seeking solutions for.**

Since May 2023, I have worked as **Research Profile Curator at the University of Toronto’s Division of the Vice-President, Research & Innovation** for DiscoverResearch, a research expertise discovery and networking web-based tool. This project aims to connect faculty members to prospective collaborators, students, and media personnel with an emphasis on maintaining accurate professional data. Since launching publicly in June 2023, the website has amassed over **450,000 views** and attracted **90,000 users worldwide.**
